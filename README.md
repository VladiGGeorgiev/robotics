# Differential Drive Robot with ROS2

The project involves creating a simulation of a differential drive robot to facilitate learning in several areas: constructing robots, developing simulated environments, planning movements in complex environment, and understanding robot kinematics and dynamics. Utilizing tools such as ROS2, Gazebo, and RViz.
